### Your response

For our planning, we would kindly ask you to respond *within two weeks upon receiving this invitation* by filling in our [online form](https://cloud.jusa.at/index.php/apps/forms/s/jstAx4mtPyWRD3TcBKRLdnE5).

Of course, we are aware that also upon accepting the invitation, unexpected things can happen that prevent you from joining - in that case, just let us know as soon as possible.

### Additional, but just as important points

- Dress code is mildly formal - please wear something in which you like to have photos taken of you, but in which you also feel physically comfortable for the day. The celebration will take place in August - hence, a light shirt and pants is a better choice than a heavy <nobr>suit. 👒</nobr>

- There is absolutely no need to bring presents or even flowers. You being there is the best and biggest <nobr>gift! 🥰</nobr>

- After the reception (with drinks) we start the afternoon by enjoying the wedding cake as well as a dessert <nobr>buffet. 🍰</nobr><br/> In the evening, dinner will be served à la carte. Here, you will be able to choose from a marvelous selection of vegetarian (or vegan) dishes to your <nobr>liking. 🥗</nobr>
      
- Drinks will be provided during the reception and can be ordered throughout the whole afternoon/evening. It's summer, so make sure to drink <nobr>plenty! 🍹</nobr>
      
- We will have access to both an inner and outer area of the location. Therefore, the celebration should be able to go through regardless of the <nobr>weather. ☔️</nobr>
      
- Well after dinner, we ask you to dance. Don't worry about this part, there will not be a competition - just dance if you feel like it. Further below some short instructions on how to dance Waltz, for those of you not too familiar with it <nobr>yet. 💃🏼</nobr>

See you in summer, and we are looking forward to spending this day together!
