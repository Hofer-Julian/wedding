For our planning, we would kindly ask you to respond to this message *within two weeks upon receiving it* with one out of three options:

1) Yes, I/we will gladly be there! → 🥳

2) Unfortunately, I/we can't make it, but have fun! → 🥲

3) I/we would like to join, but would need time until dd-mm-yyyy to be sure! → 🧐

We hope that as many of you as possible can answer with the first option!<br/>In that fortunate case, please also share the following information with us right away:
- How many people will you be? (relevant for families/couples)
- Would you like to use the shuttleservice from/to Salzburg main station?
- Would you like our support finding a nice accomodation in Salzburg?
- Do you have allergies or dietary restrictions?

Of course we are aware that also upon accepting the invitation, unexpected things can happen that prevent you from joining - in that case, just let us know as soon as possible.

**Additional, but just as important points:**

- Dress code is mildly formal - please wear something in which you like to have photos taken of you, but in which you also feel physically comfortable for the day. The celebration will take place in August - hence, a light shirt and pants is likely a better choice than a heavy suit. 👒

- There is absolutely no need to bring presents or even flowers. You being there is the best and biggest gift! 🥰

- After the reception (with drinks) we start the afternoon by enjoying the wedding cake as well as a dessert buffet. 🍰<br/>In the evening, dinner will be served à la carte. Here, you will be able to choose from a marvelous selection of vegetarian (or vegan) dishes to your liking. 🥗
      
- Drinks will be provided during the reception and can be ordered throughout the whole afternoon/evening. It's summer, so make sure to drink plenty! 🍹
      
- We will have access to both an inner and outer area of the location. Therefore, the celebration should be able to go through regardless of the weather. ☔️
      
- Well after dinner, we ask you to dance. Don't worry about this part, there will not be a competition - just dance if you feel like it. Further below some short instructions on how to dance Waltz, for those of you not too familiar with it yet. 💃🏼

See you in summer, and we are looking forward to spending this day together!
